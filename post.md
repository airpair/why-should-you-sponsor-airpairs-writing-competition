##1 Introduction

Interested in fresh thought leading content about your company's technology or API?

This month we are announcing a 3 month long [writing competition](https://www.airpair.com/100k-writing-competition) to celebrate the release of our new Github API powered, collaborative publishing tools. Our new platform allows anyone to fork posts and submit pull requests to fix typos and make suggestions.

We're giving away $5k, $3k & $2k in cash prizes to the three most shared posts, with many smaller category prizes from $150-$1500.

We'd like to help companies generate fresh top notch tutorials and thought pieces, to stimulate community activity and create more awareness of your technology amongst the wider AirPair community. 

##2 Why should we sponsor? 

###2.1 AirPair Reader numbers

With over **3 million pageviews in 6 months**, we are currently one of the Web's best places to find technical content.

A good post published on Airpair can expect **40,000 pageviews** in it's first week, or **200,000+ over it's "lifetime"** (a number that keeps growing as lifetime right now means about 10 months).

It's success largely depends on how many readers share it (some posts accumulate more than **11,000+ shares on social media**) which depends on quality, subject matter, author reputation and a bit of luck (e.g trending on HackerNews), but an **average post still gets about 15,000 readers**.

*Check out the stats on the [best posts published in 2014](link to ellen's blog). *

####2.1.1 Engagement & Demographics 

The average time spent reading a post is 6-8 minutes and about 80% of our readers are unique. 

33% of our readers come from the US, 8% from India, 5% from the UK, and 3% from Canada. 

###2.2 Exposure

As a sponsor we will provide you with: 
- a **full post** on our site explaining what you would like developers to write about
- **logo placement** on [our competition page](https://www.airpair.com/100k-writing-competition) with a link to your site, or to your post on our site
- a **blurb (140 characters) in our weekly roundup** of top posts of the week
- a **blurb (140 characters) in our bi-weekly newsletter** to 11,000+ subscribers
- **2 tweets per week** mentioning your support as sponsor
- special Airpair **promotional treatment** for all posts related to your technology

We would also like to invite you to post "sponsor updates" about any new features or updates you are releasing in the next 3 months. 

<br>
*Let us know if there you would like to be exposed through other channels.*

###What other like minded companies are participating?
We already have a few partners sponsoring $500 prizes for the best post about their company's technology. Consult [our competition page](https://www.airpair.com/100k-writing-competition) to see who is participating. 

###2.3 Case Studies

Firebase became one of our sponsors when they saw the impact created by a recent post on Airpair, [Build a Real Time Hybrid App with Ionic & Firebase](https://www.airpair.com/angularjs/posts/build-a-real-time-hybrid-app-with-ionic-firebase). 

It received 5,500+ pageviews in just 2 weeks, with visitors spending an average of 6.5 minutes engaged with the content.

###2.4 Why sponsor this competition and not an event?  

By sponsoring this competition, you are making it easier to convince key developers to take the time to write about their experiences using **your technology**, encouraging thousands of other developers to give it a spin. 

And unlike an event, the content will exist on the web for years to come, updated as is required, guaranteeing **long term ROI**.

*At the end of the competition, we will send you a summary of the articles posted about your technology, along with relevant statistics like pageviews and number of shares across social media.*

###2.5 Topics of Interest/Level of knowledge

Posts on Airpair generally fit into one of 3 categories:
- Step by Step Tutorials (e.g [Building a RESTful API in a Rails Application](http://www.airpair.com/ruby-on-rails/posts/building-a-restful-api-in-a-rails-application))
- Informative Comparison pieces (e.g [Hybrid UI framework shootout: Ionic vs. Famo.us vs. F7 vs. OnsenUI](https://www.airpair.com/ionic-framework/posts/hybrid-apps-ionic-famous-f7-onsen))
- Opinion pieces (e.g [The Top 10 Mistakes AngularJS Developers Make](http://www.airpair.com/angularjs/posts/top-10-mistakes-angularjs-developers-make)). 
<br><br>

They cover all technologies and platforms, and can be Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced. 

You can check out the [best posts published in 2014](link to ellen's blog) to get an idea of what our audience is interested in.

###2.6 Editing

All content goes through a peer review process, and an internal editing process prior to being published. 

*Let us know if you would like to be involved in this process to proofread any content about your technology.*

##3 How can we boost the impact of our sponsorship?

There are 3 ways to take an active role in helping to create the new champions and heroes of your technology - through Prizes, Sharing and Peer Review. 

###3.1 Prizes

**Creating awesome content costs money**. Writing an article can take anywhere from 5-40 hours, and our authors are developers who can charge up to $200/hr. Your cash prize of $500 will help to cover some of their expenses, however you can also offer other sponsorship ideas such as free credits to your services for entrants and winners, or bigger cash prizes. 

*With a good chance of multiple submissions, and a commissioned tutorial costing anywhere from $2,000-$3,000, we hope you'll agree that $500 is a relatively small investment. *

###3.2 Sharing

*Money isn't everything*. For authors, sharing their knowledge, experience and opinions is a way to support the community, interact with the community, and give back. This for them `= impact`. Plus they are likely to land some properly paid development work as a result. 

If you take the time to support authors by sharing their content with your community, you can encourage even more developers to write about their experiences using your technology.

###3.3 Peer Review

The better the content, the more impact it will create, and the longer it will live on the web, so the goal is to publish **high quality, relevant content**. This is why we designed our [Github powered collaborative authoring tools](link to JK's article) - to make it as easy and fun as possible for developers to review content, test code, and submit edits. 

If you encourage **developers in your community** to evaluate and critique the content submitted about your technology *before* it's published, you can increase the quality and impact of your investment.
