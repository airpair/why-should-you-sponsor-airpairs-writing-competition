##Introduction

Interested in fresh thought leading content about your company's technology or API?

This month we are announcing a 3 month long [writing competition](https://www.airpair.com/100k-writing-competition) to celebrate the release of our new Github API powered, collaborative publishing tools. Our new platform allows anyone to fork posts and submit pull requests to fix typos and make suggestions.

We're giving away $5k, $3k & $2k in cash prizes to the three most shared posts, with many smaller category prizes from $150-$1500.

##Why sponsor? 

We'd like to help companies to generate fresh top notch tutorials and thought pieces, stimulating community activity and creating more awareness of your technology amongst the wider AirPair community. 

###Reader numbers

With over **3 million pageviews in 6 months**, we are currently one of the Web's best places to find technical content.

A good post published on Airpair can expect **40,000 pageviews** in it's first week, or **200,000+ over it's "lifetime"** (a number that keeps growing as lifetime right now means about 10 months). 

It's success largely depends on how many readers share it (some posts accumulate more than **11,000+ shares on social media**) which depends on quality, subject matter, author reputation and a bit of luck (e.g trending on HackerNews), but an **average post still gets about 15,000 readers**.

*Check out the stats on the [best posts published in 2014](link to ellen's blog). *

###Engagement

The average time spent reading a post is 6-8 minutes and about 80% of our readers are unique. 

###Demographics 

33% of our readers come from the US, 8% from India, 5% from the UK, and 3% from Canada.

<br>
*Let us know if there you would like to be exposed through other channels.*

###What other like minded companies are participating?
We already have a few partners sponsoring $500 prizes for the best post about their company's technology. Consult [our competition page](https://www.airpair.com/100k-writing-competition) to see who is participating. 

###Case Studies

Firebase became one of our sponsors when they saw the impact created by a recent post on Airpair: [Build a Real Time Hybrid App with Ionic & Firebase](https://www.airpair.com/angularjs/posts/build-a-real-time-hybrid-app-with-ionic-firebase) that drove vistors to their site to try out their platform.

###Why sponsor this competition and not an event?  

By sponsoring this competition, you are making it easier to convince key developers to take the time to write about their experiences using **your technology**, encouraging thousands of other developers to give it a spin. 

And unlike an event, the content will exist on the web for years to come, updated as is required, guaranteeing **long term ROI**.

*At the end of the competition, we will send you a summary of the articles posted about your technology, along with relevant statistics like pageviews and number of shares across social media.*

###Topics of Interest/Level of knowledge

Posts on Airpair generally fit into one of 3 categories:
- Step by Step Tutorials (e.g [Building a RESTful API in a Rails Application](http://www.airpair.com/ruby-on-rails/posts/building-a-restful-api-in-a-rails-application))
- Informative Comparison pieces (e.g [Hybrid UI framework shootout: Ionic vs. Famo.us vs. F7 vs. OnsenUI](https://www.airpair.com/ionic-framework/posts/hybrid-apps-ionic-famous-f7-onsen))
- Opinion pieces (e.g [The Top 10 Mistakes AngularJS Developers Make](http://www.airpair.com/angularjs/posts/top-10-mistakes-angularjs-developers-make)). 
<br><br>

They cover all technologies and platforms, and can be Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced. 

You can check out the [best posts published in 2014](link to ellen's blog) to get an idea of what our audience is interested in.

###Editing

All content goes through a peer review process, and an internal editing process prior to being published. 

*Let us know if you would like to be involved in this process to proofread any content about your technology.*

##How you can support us as a sponsor

In order to help us to encourage developers to write about **your platform** instead of another technology, we need your help in three key ways - Money, Impact and Peers. 

###**Money.**

**Creating awesome content costs money**. Writing an article can take anywhere from 5-40 hours, and our authors are developers who can charge up to $200/hr. We're not asking you to match their rate, but we ask that you provide a cash prize of $500 to cover some of their expenses. 

*Other sponsorship ideas such as free credits to your services for entrants and winners, or bigger cash prizes can be discussed. Please email [team@airpair.com](team@airpair.com).*

###**Impact.**

*Money isn't everything*. For authors, sharing their knowledge, experience and opinions is a way to support the community, interact with the community, and give back. This for them `= impact`. Plus they are likely to land some properly paid development work as a result. 

We need your help to increase the impact of any posts related to your technology, by sharing them with your community.  

###**Peers.**

The better the content, the more impact it will create, and the longer it will live on the web, so we need to ensure we are publishing **high quality, relevant content**. This is why we've designed our [Github powered collaborative authoring tools](link to JK's article) - to make it as easy and fun as possible for developers to review content, test code, and submit edits. 

We need your help to encourage **developers in your community** to evaluate and critique relevant content about your technology *before* it's published. 


>With these **three assurances** in place, of a cash prize, sharing relevant content amongst your community and asking other developers to participate in peer review, it will be easy to encourage developers to write about their experiences using your technology. 

##Iâ€™m interested, what's next?

Please email [team@airpair.com](team@airpair.com) to set up a call. We will clarify any questions you have and send a sponsorship package with all the details.
