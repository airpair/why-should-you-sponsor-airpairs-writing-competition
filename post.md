## ROI on Internal vs Community Content

Internal content production is time consuming, expensive and scales linearly with the number of writers on staff. 

Capturing excited community members will be of benefit in the following ways:

- Scale content production by # of engaged power users instead of internal team size.
- Encourage beginner, intermediate and advanced knowledge share inspired by real-world usage rather than *The Kitchen Sink*.
- Access additional forms of content like:
  - Tips, tricks & mistakes from the trenches
  - Authentic *in production* customer success stories
  - More permutations using your tech with different stacks and other APIs
  - Breed a networking effect of authentic grass roots evangelism. 

Content published on AirPair will also assist you with maintenance costs. AirPair's **[Social Authoring tools](//airpair.com/preview/draft/jk-git-authoring-annoucement)** enable the community to edit, improve and maintain posts as you release new framework versions.
