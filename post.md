## ROI on Internal vs Community Content

Internal content production is time consuming, expensive and scales linearly with the number of writers on staff. 

Capturing excited community members will benefit in following ways:

- Scale content production by # of engaged power users instead of internal team size.
- Encourage beginner, intermediate and advanced knowledge share inspired by real-world usage rather than *The Kitchen Sink*.
- Access additional forms of content like:
  - Tips, tricks & mistakes from the trenches
  - Authentic *in production* customer success stories
  - More permutations using your tech with different stacks and other APIs
  - Breed a networking effect of authentic grass roots evangelism. 

Content published on AirPair will also assist you with maintenance costs. AirPair's **[Social Authoring tools](//airpair.com/preview/draft/jk-git-authoring-annoucement)** enable the community to edit, improve and maintain posts as you release new framework versions.

## Access AirPair's Growing Reader Base

##3 How can we boost the impact of our sponsorship?

There are 3 ways to take an active role in helping to create the new champions and heroes of your technology - through Prizes, Sharing and Peer Review. 

###3.1 Prizes

**Creating awesome content costs money**. Writing an article can take anywhere from 5-40 hours, and our authors are developers who can charge up to $200/hr. Your cash prize of $500 will help to cover some of their expenses, however you can also offer other sponsorship ideas such as free credits to your services for entrants and winners, or bigger cash prizes. 

*With a good chance of multiple submissions, and a commissioned tutorial costing anywhere from $2,000-$3,000, we hope you'll agree that $500 is a relatively small investment. *

###3.2 Sharing

*Money isn't everything*. For authors, sharing their knowledge, experience and opinions is a way to support the community, interact with the community, and give back. This for them `= impact`. Plus they are likely to land some properly paid development work as a result. 

If you take the time to support authors by sharing their content with your community, you can encourage even more developers to write about their experiences using your technology.

###3.3 Peer Review

The better the content, the more impact it will create, and the longer it will live on the web, so the goal is to publish **high quality, relevant content**. This is why we designed our Github powered collaborative authoring tools - to make it as easy and fun as possible for developers to review content, test code, and submit edits. 

If you encourage **developers in your community** to evaluate and critique the content submitted about your technology *before* it's published, you can increase the quality and impact of your investment.

## What's involved?

### Minimum requirements

To be listed as a sponsor, you must provide at least one $500 cash prize for the author whose post about your technology has the `highest community ratings` multiplied by `number of social shares`.

### Collaborating for more mileage

We have a schedule and a set of activies that will stimulate participation from your community. Things from tweeting, to more warm introductions to people you already know. If you're interested, we'd love to chat and share more.

### Meeting your champions

All content goes through a peer review process prior to being published. Your team can optional be invovled in the review process, meet those building greats things with your tech and help improve and shape every piece before it's published.
