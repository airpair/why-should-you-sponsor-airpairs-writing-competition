## 1 ROI on Internal vs Community Content

#### Making great content yourself is hard ####

Content production is time consuming and expensive. Producing your own content scales linearly with the number of writers you have on staff. Furthermore, Developers using your technology to solve real world problems will have inspiration to write more unique angels than staff paid to think up use cases.

#### How community produced content scales ####

Capturing excited community members is impactful in the following ways:

- It stimulates a network effect of authentic grass roots evangelism.
- Spread knowledge by speed of engaged power users instead vs internal team size.
- Unlock alternative forms of content like:
  - Authentic *in production* customer success stories.
  - Cover more permutations of hybrid pieces combining your technology others like:
    - YourAPI on Rails
    - YourAPI on NodeJS
    - YourAPI + AnotherAPI
    - etc. etc.

#### Reduce costs with Crowdsourced  maintainance ####

### 3.3 Case Study

Firebase became one of our sponsors when they saw the impact created by a recent post on Airpair, [Build a Real Time Hybrid App with Ionic & Firebase](https://www.airpair.com/angularjs/posts/build-a-real-time-hybrid-app-with-ionic-firebase). 

It received 5,500+ pageviews in just 2 weeks, with visitors spending an average of 6.5 minutes engaged with the content.

### 3.4 Why sponsor content instead of an event?  

By sponsoring this competition, you are making it easier to convince key developers to take the time to write about their experiences using **your technology**, encouraging thousands of other developers to give it a spin. 

And unlike an event, the content will exist on the web for years to come, updated as is required, guaranteeing **long term ROI**.

*At the end of the competition, we will send you a summary of the articles posted about your technology, along with relevant statistics like pageviews and number of shares across social media.*

### 3.4 Meeting your champions while Editing

All content goes through a peer review process prior to being published. You'll be exposed to the ideas your community wants to share well before they become public, meaning your team can help improve and shape every piece.

*Let us know if you would like to be involved in this process to proofread any content about your technology.*

##3 How can we boost the impact of our sponsorship?

There are 3 ways to take an active role in helping to create the new champions and heroes of your technology - through Prizes, Sharing and Peer Review. 

<!-- ###3.1 Prizes

**Creating awesome content costs money**. Writing an article can take anywhere from 5-40 hours, and our authors are developers who can charge up to $200/hr. Your cash prize of $500 will help to cover some of their expenses, however you can also offer other sponsorship ideas such as free credits to your services for entrants and winners, or bigger cash prizes. 

*With a good chance of multiple submissions, and a commissioned tutorial costing anywhere from $2,000-$3,000, we hope you'll agree that $500 is a relatively small investment. *

###3.2 Sharing

*Money isn't everything*. For authors, sharing their knowledge, experience and opinions is a way to support the community, interact with the community, and give back. This for them `= impact`. Plus they are likely to land some properly paid development work as a result. 

If you take the time to support authors by sharing their content with your community, you can encourage even more developers to write about their experiences using your technology.

###3.3 Peer Review

The better the content, the more impact it will create, and the longer it will live on the web, so the goal is to publish **high quality, relevant content**. This is why we designed our Github powered collaborative authoring tools - to make it as easy and fun as possible for developers to review content, test code, and submit edits. 

If you encourage **developers in your community** to evaluate and critique the content submitted about your technology *before* it's published, you can increase the quality and impact of your investment.
